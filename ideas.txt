jumping:
randomly try a few things until can get closer, test 5 points if finds something good, then just give it an impulse and constrain orientation (maybe it could be just a special case with hoverupright)
constrain orientation for a fixed time, maybe while jumping it keeps upright and forward balance,
need to decide when jumping is needed


better tail
arms could move as running
similarly head could track target


deal with swinting left to right being bad for speed
-maybe there's a separate orientation variable slowly moving toward desired (or current) rotation that is used for movement. 

acid blood
-check gorefx for normal and such
-acid from acid gun (one less bad for frames)
-a lot first then timer for less (how to do timer?)


Think about moving hands
-probably would use one way constraining

robot has issues due to long steps: set up running

Bezier is not needed
